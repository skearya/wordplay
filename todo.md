# current todo:

- page transitions with solid-transition-group

- open graph images

- client and server version checking

- use tracing

- probably look into using dashmap instead of std hashmap for global game data for concurrent references

- store and display previous winners of session

- probably use parking_lot because panics with a mutex lock DONT poison i think

- future word games: greentea

- review all `.unwrap()`s
